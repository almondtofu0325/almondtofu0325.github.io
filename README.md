i never want to make a website again, this was so time-consuming  ðŸ˜­.
i guess it was kinda fun though.
still, i spent my time coding this website instead of studying  ðŸ˜­.

i just lost 15 years of my life from coding this tbh. 
jk i actually just spent like 15 hours.





you're cool <3

have a nice day!

thanks
