i never want to make a website again, this was so time-consuming  😭.
i guess it was kinda fun though.
still, i spent my time coding this website instead of studying  😭.

i just lost 15 years of my life from coding this tbh. 
jk i actually just spent like 15 hours.

i haven't figured out how to format it on different screen sizes yet, so yeah. It works on 1920x1080 👍

have a nice day!

thanks
